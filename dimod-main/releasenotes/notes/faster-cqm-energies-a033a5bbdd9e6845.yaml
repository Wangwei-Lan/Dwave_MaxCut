features:
  - Speed up the construction of `Variables` objects from a `range` or another `Variables`.
  - Add optional keyword argument ``labels_type`` to the ``as_samples()`` function.
  - |
    Speed up ``BinaryQuadraticModel.energies()`` and ``QuadraticModel.energies()`` in cases
    where the model has a small subset of the variables in the samples.
  - |
    Speed up ``SampleSet.from_samples_cqm()`` in cases where there are constraints
    with a small number of variables relative to the objective.
