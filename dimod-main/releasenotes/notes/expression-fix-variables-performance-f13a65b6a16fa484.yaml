features:
  - |
    Improve the performance of fixing and removing variables from constrained
    quadratic model expressions.
  - |
    Implement the ``Expression::fix_variable()`` C++ method. Previously it would
    throw ``std::logic_error("not implemented - fix_variable")``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Add an overload to the C++ ``QuadraticModel::remove_variable()`` method.
    This is binary compatible, but it makes ``&remove_variable`` ambiguous.
