features:
  - |
    Add ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.set_lower_bound()`` method.
    See `#1105 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/issues/1105>`_.
  - |
    Add ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.set_upper_bound()`` method.
    See `#1105 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/issues/1105>`_.
upgrade:
  - |
    Bounds for integer variables are no longer rounded to the nearest int
    in ``QuadraticModel`` and ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel``.
fixes:
  - |
    It is no longer possible to add an integer variables to a quadratic model
    with bounds that do not include at least one integer between them.
    E.g. ``qm.add_variable('INTEGER', 'v', lower_bound=1.2, upper_bound=1.5)``
    will now raise a ``ValueError``.
  - |
    ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_variable()`` now correctly raises an error
    when a variable is added twice with inconsistent bounds.
  - |
    ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_variable()`` now correctly returns the
    variable label when a variable is added twice.
