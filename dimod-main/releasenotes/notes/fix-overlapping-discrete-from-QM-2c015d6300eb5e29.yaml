    ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_discrete()``,
    ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_constraint_from_iterable()``, and
    ``ConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_discrete_from_model()``
    now correctly raise an error when given a binary variable that overlaps with an existing
    discrete constraint.
    See `#1149 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/issues/1149>`_.
