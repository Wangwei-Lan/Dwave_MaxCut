features:
  - |
    Backport the use of ``dimod.views.quadratic.Adjacency``,
    ``dimod.views.quadratic.Linear``, and ``dimod.views.quadratic.Quadratic``
    for use with the deprecated ``AdjVectorBQM`` and ``AdjDictBQM`` binary
    quadratic model classes.
  - |
    Backport ``iter_neighborhood()``, ``reduce_linear()``,
    ``reduce_neighborhood()``, and ``reduce_quadratic()`` methods for use with
    the deprecated ``AdjVectorBQM`` and ``AdjDictBQM`` binary quadratic model classes.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix instance and subclass testing between deprecated and modern binary
    quadratic model views.
    For example ``instance(bqm.quadratic, dimod.core.bqm.BQMView)`` now returns
    ``True`` for modern binary quadratic models.
